## resolve_api.py

IDAPython script that will set a comment to the API resolver function, with its resolved function name and DLL file name.
It is expected to run on 64-bit Windows machine, since it reads DLL file under `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\` at default.
Please change value stored in `API_RESOLVER_ADDR` (the address of API resolver function) depending on sample.
